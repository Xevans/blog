- what content will the site contain?
- about me (home)
    - general about me + picture

    - preview of hobbies: gaming, coding useful tools, playing around with 8-bit music making, animation, writing my novel, game development,

coding projects, renders projects list.
each is a route to a new page, manually authored by me.

Do for each category, then start authoring!
