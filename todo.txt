Brainstorm blog designs
- what content will the site contain?
- about me (home)
    - general about me + picture
    - preview of career interests: favorite technologies, roles of interest, plans
    - preview of hobbies: gaming, coding useful tools, playing around with 8-bit music making, animation, writing my novel, game development,
    - coding projects:


Project pages (links in the nav) will load the featured blog onto the main left half of the screen.
Leaving the remaining 20% for a column of more blogs within the category that can be scrolled seperately.


Each post is going to have to be its own route.
This model supports routing from the main categories and authoring new posts.

coding projects, renders projects list.
each is a route to a new page, manually authored by me.

Do for each category, then start authoring!

We can do a Nextjs migration once the project is live and being served.

Frontend Technologies: Vite, React, Typescript
State Management tools: useEffect, Context
Routing Tools: React-router
Styling Tools: Tailwind CSS

Tasks:

- Add a logo to the nav bar (done)
- Change picture on the main page (done)
- Add context to keep track of where you are via the nav bar indicators. (done)
    - e.g if I click on a link on the main content and I go to another route, the highlighted nav element should update accordingly.

- Make mobile view nav button work (looking into headless ui's disclosure button) https://headlessui.com/react/disclosure (done)
- Add linkedin button on footer (done)
- Fix blog list in mobile view


- Work on dev blog articles
- work on writing blog articles
- Add playground route
    - I want to try an interactive sound-input app
    - user clicks a key and a sound is played.
    - chiptune playing game or tracker type game.


Firebase data fetch design:
    - Home route
        - fetch from the featured blog collection
    - Blog list component
        - if no data in blog previews context
            - fetch title, blurb, category, date, tags of documents in the corresponding collection
    - Blog Article
        - fetch the document via the identifyer in the route params and update the 'current blog' context.

        
        - Now the problem. How do I send a link to a specific article? This is all just DOM and context manipulation so far.
            - See Q/A for adding params to routes: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75491261/how-can-i-dynamically-create-a-route-in-react
                (dynamically create routes using ID's that corespond with some obj to be retrieved.)

        
Vite was not hosting to the correct local host when hosted in a dev container.
Fix: Adding the following config fixed the hosting params.
server: {
    port: 8002,
    host: '127.0.0.1'
}



How to upload to firebase? 
Will use make use of a seperate private app that will authenticate and write that way.

In firebase the docRef ID is the name of the document (e.g. creating-this-blog).

When viewing blog list using Firestore data, you could leverage the individual docRef IDs to pass to a global context to know which blog to fetch.
If there is no url based approach, we can make a context: BlogID

-----------------


Tasks:
- Implement dynamic fetch and render to dev-blogs/diary/:id (leverage use param in react router) [done]
- Implement dynamic fetch and render to dev blog list (maybe show a preview image? [think like a rectangle left 1/3 is image, right 2/3 is text]) [done]
    - start by writing wrapper function implementation for retreival in firebase util
    - then add a call to wrapper function with test param(s).

- Apply above to other blog routes
