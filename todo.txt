Brainstorm blog designs
- what content will the site contain?
- about me (home)
    - general about me + picture
    - preview of career interests: favorite technologies, roles of interest, plans
    - preview of hobbies: gaming, coding useful tools, playing around with 8-bit music making, animation, writing my novel, game development,
    - coding projects:


Project pages (links in the nav) will load the featured blog onto the main left half of the screen.
Leaving the remaining 20% for a column of more blogs within the category that can be scrolled seperately.


Each post is going to have to be its own route.
This model supports routing from the main categories and authoring new posts.

coding projects, renders projects list.
each is a route to a new page, manually authored by me.

Do for each category, then start authoring!

Firebase data fetch design:
    - want to put the firebase call in a top level context that inits iteself with the blog data.
        - do we need to retain entire objects?
        - No. Example: could only retrieve title, blurb, category, date, tags
            - This would be enough to populate cards and previews.
            - When a specific blog is requested, we can update the context for the current blog
            - this will fetch the complete object for the particular blog.
            - Now the problem. How do I send a link to a specific article? This is all just DOM manipulation so far.
                - See Q/A for adding params to routes: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75491261/how-can-i-dynamically-create-a-route-in-react
                    (dynamically create routes using ID's that corespond with some obj to be retrieved.)
